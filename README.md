# Classroom Controller
Create a program that allows your user to control a classroom. Import both the Classroom class and an Reader class and use the two together to allow the user to make a selection from the following main menu and make it work:
* If the user chooses A, the program will prompt the user for an integer and add that many students to the room. (Think about how to use loops for this.)
* If the user chooses R, the program will prompt the user for an integer and remove that many students to the room (if the number exceeds the number of students in the room, the room will remain at zero)
* If the user chooses L, the program will prompt the user for an integer and turn on that number light. The program may only accept a valid light number (1, 2 or 3).
* If the user chooses O, the program will prompt the user for an integer and turn off that number light.
* If the user chooses Q, the program will quit.

Other options should be provided to fit in with the other features of your classroom.
